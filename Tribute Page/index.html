                About the Legend

            <p>
                ☛ <span class="highlight">Dr. Bhim Rao Ambedkar</span>, a fighter in the cause of Annihilation of Caste, was born in a low-caste Mahar family on April 14, 1891, at Mhow cantonment, where his father served in the Army.<br><br>
                ☛ Despite being born in a caste considered the lowest of the low, he framed the <span class="highlight">Constitution of India</span>.<br><br>
                ☛ His life was one of struggles, facing overt hostility from upper castes due to his radical proposals to deal with the caste system.<br><br>
                ☛ He earned a Doctorate in Economics from <span class="highlight">Columbia University</span> in 1917, overcoming immense social odds.<br><br>
                ☛ The boy who suffered bitter caste humiliation became the first <span class="highlight">Minister for Law</span> in free India and shaped the country’s Constitution.<br><br>
                ☛ Dr. Ambedkar's struggle against Brahmanical Patriarchy and his proposals for the <span class="highlight">Hindu Code Bill</span> and restructuring of property relations highlighted his challenge to the status quo.<br><br>
                ☛ He transformed the social and political landscape by making the downtrodden aware of their own situation during the struggle against British colonialism.<br><br>
                ☛ Ambedkar famously urged Dalits to “<span class="highlight">Educate, Agitate, and Organise</span>,” emphasizing education as a tool for empowerment.<br><br>
                ☛ He believed education was more important than temple entry for the downtrodden and saw it as a means to build an egalitarian society and break discriminatory social practices.<br><br>
